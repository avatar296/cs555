## Adding Explanations to Questions

To help you learn from your mistakes, you can add explanations to questions:

### Method 1: Interactive Script
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 add_explanations.py
```

This will guide you through adding explanations to each question in a quiz.

### Method 2: Direct SQL
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3
```

```python
from database import QuizDatabase

db = QuizDatabase('quiz_study.db')

# Add explanation to a specific question
db.conn.execute("""
    UPDATE questions
    SET explanation = 'Your explanation here'
    WHERE id = 1
""")

db.close()
```

### How Explanations Appear

When you get an answer wrong, you'll see:
```
âœ— Incorrect
The correct answer is: False

ðŸ’¡ Why?
[Your explanation will appear here]
```

Explanations also appear in the results page for review.
