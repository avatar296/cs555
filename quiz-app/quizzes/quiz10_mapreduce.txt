Consider a particular reducer RX that has received 1000 intermediate outputs from mappers; these intermediate outputs correspond to 100 unique keys. The question below pertains to execution of the reduce function in the reducer RX.

If the reducer RX fails, all mappers must be re-executed to retrieve their intermediate outputs for the newly launched replacement for reducer RX.
