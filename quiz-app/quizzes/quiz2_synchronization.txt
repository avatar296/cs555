Consider a class A that has two synchronized methods s1() and s2();   this class also has two unsynchronized methods u1() and u2().  Class A was used to create two object instances, a1 and a2, in a particular process P.  Within the process P, there are N threads that are represented as T1, T2, …, TN.   Please indicate if the following statement is True/False.

Thread T1 can be active in a1.s1() and Thread T2 can be active in a2.s2() at the same time.

Correct answer:

True

False
