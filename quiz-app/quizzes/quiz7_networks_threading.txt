A regular graph is one in which the n nodes are organized in a ring, with each node directly connected to its nearest k neighbors. In random graphs on the other hand, the vertices are connected to each other at random. Pathlength refers to the average number of hops needed to reach any node from any other node in the graph. The clustering coefficient is the measure of the level of clustering between the neighboring nodes for any vertex-node in the system.

One advantage of a worker pool is that the number of worker threads is fixed, so, the number of threads may be too few to adequately cope with the rate of requests. Additionally, one disadvantage of a worker pool is that you need to account for coordinated accesses to the shared queue.
