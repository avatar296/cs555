Consider a P2P system where peers are organized in a ring structure. Two peers in this system have IDs 4980 and 5220; assume there are no other peers with IDs that fall between 4981 through 5219.  A data item with hash-code (4992) will be stored at  Peer 5219 in Chord.

Correct answer:

True

False

Consider a P2P system where the peers have 160-bit IDs but the content identifiers are generated using MD5 (128-bits).  In this system: (1) there are thousands of peers who IDs are randomly generated using the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function, and (2) billions of data items that need to be stored. Once the storage operations have been completed, most of the peers will have no (or very few) stored elements.

Correct answer:

True

False
