## Key Learning Principles Covered

### Concurrency Concepts
- **Mutual Exclusion**: One lock per object, synchronized methods can't run concurrently
- **Reentrancy**: Java locks are reentrant - threads can reacquire locks they hold
- **Context Switching**: Thread switches are cheaper than process switches
- **Memory Visibility**: Both reads and writes need synchronization
- **Race Conditions**: Timing-dependent bugs that may not appear under light load

### Distributed Systems Concepts
- **DHT Routing**: Logarithmic routing (O(log N)) vs linear (O(N))
- **Replication**: Essential for fault tolerance in P2P systems
- **Load Balancing**: Hash functions provide uniform distribution
- **Successor vs Closest**: Chord uses successor, Pastry uses numerically closest

### Performance Tradeoffs
- **Amdahl's Law**: Serial portions limit maximum speedup
- **Lock Granularity**: Coarse-grained reduces concurrency, fine-grained increases complexity
- **Latency vs Throughput**: Optimizing one may hurt the other
- **Thread Pooling**: Bounded resources vs potential underutilization

## How Explanations Appear

### During Quiz
When you answer incorrectly:
```
âœ— Incorrect
The correct answer is: False

ðŸ’¡ Why?
Each thread has its own program counter to track its individual
execution position. While threads share the same memory space and
resources, they maintain separate execution contexts including their
own program counters, stack pointers, and register states.
```

### In Results Review
All incorrect answers show explanations in the detailed results page, allowing you to:
- Review what you got wrong
- Understand the correct concept
- Learn the underlying principles
- Prepare better for the midterm
